        <p>During <strong>spring break</strong>, I had the incredible opportunity to visit the Big Island of Hawaii. 
            It was a dream come true, filled with adventure, nature, and unforgettable marine life encounters.</p>
        <p>One of the most exciting experiences of the trip was the famous manta ray night snorkel tour. I had heard so much about it and couldn't wait to see these gentle giants up close, 
            especially in <em>Keauhou Bay</em>, which is known for its vibrant ocean life.</p>
        <p>As the sun set, we boarded the boat and set out to the designated viewing site. The sky turned orange and pink, 
            reflecting beautifully on the ocean surface. It was already magical before we even got in the water.</p>
        <p>Once we slipped into the water, we were instructed to hold onto a floating light board that attracted plankton. Almost immediately, the manta rays began to appear, gracefully gliding beneath us in search of food. 
            Our guide explained that the light stimulates a mini food chain, with <abbr title="phytoplankton">phyto</abbr> and zooplankton drawing in the rays.</p>
        <p>Watching them loop and spin just <small>inches</small> away was both exhilarating and calming. Their wingspans were massive, and their movements so fluid. It felt like a slow, underwater ballet. 
            One ray even brushed my arms as it did a graceful somersault below me.</p>
        <p id="#lastParagraph">I later wrote about the experience in my journal and included a reference to a <mark>marine study on manta ray behavior</mark> to better understand what we saw.
            It was a humbling experience that I’ll never forget and one I would highly recommend to anyone visiting the Big Island.</p>
