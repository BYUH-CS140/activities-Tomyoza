        <h3>If you were a boat, what type would you be?</h3>
        <p>If I were a boat, I would be a cruise ship because a cruise ship is huge, 
            so calm, steady, and peaceful even in rough seas. 
            I create a space where people can relax and feel safe no matter whatâ€™s happening around them.</p>
